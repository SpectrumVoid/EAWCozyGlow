#COZY COMES TO POWER - THESTRAL ISSUE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY
 cozycoup.1.t:0 "Rumors of Discontent"
 cozycoup.1.d:0 "Recently reports of radicals have trickled in to our government. Many citizens, it seems, are very disappointed with our lack of interventionism in foreign powers. Some agitators have claimed that the Changeling Hegemony should never have been allowed to rebuild without Equestrian supervision. They are calling for a preemptive war of aggression against the changelings to bring harmony to their lands."
 cozycoup.1.a:0 "We can't go imposing our values on others by force!"
 cozycoup.2.t:0 "Discontent Grows"
 cozycoup.2.d:0 ""
 equestria.2.d:0 "Pinkie Pie, the Element of Laughter has volunteered to go to the Buffalo as an envoy to broker an agreement between Equestria and the Buffalo. However, the risk of going alone into what probably qualifies as something close to hostile territory has given several senior military officers pause and they have directly petitioned the Crown to instead greenlight a full military 'intervention' to the Buffalo to end the problem once and for all. However, despite the Dotted Line Report, the optics of the Royal Guard engaging in what qualifies as an illegal occupation would give even the most hardened militarist in Equestria pause.\n\nOf course, while a full military occupation and invasion would definitively solve the problem of the Buffalo once and for all, even at the cost of losing the moral high ground, an envoy opens the door to both peaceful coexistence and maybe even the integration of the buffalo into Equestria itself. There's just one problem with an envoy and diplomatic propositions and pressure. The Buffalos could always end up rejecting our advances which would leave us out of options, out of a solution and out of a good image. But ultimately, a solution must be taken. What should be our course of action?"
 equestria.2.a:0 "Send the envoy. Such militaristic rhetoric does not have a place in our nation."
 equestria.2.b:0 "Start the engines, let's get this over with."
