 interventionist_harmony_desc:0 "Interventionist Harmony argues that the existence of oppressive states anywhere is incompatible with the basic tenets of harmony. Therefore, it is the state's job to free suffering creatures from their cruel masters, by force if necessary. A strong military is praised for the diplomatic weight it gives, and society is more tightly regulated to ensure the ideas of harmony do not gutter and die in this hateful world."
