 interventionist_harmony_desc:0 "Interventionist Harmony argues that the existence of oppressive states anywhere is incompatible with the basic tenets of harmony. Therefore, it is the state's job to free suffering creatures from their cruel masters, by force if necessary. A strong military is praised for the diplomatic weight it gives, and society is more tightly regulated to ensure the ideas of harmony do not gutter and die in this hateful world."

generositism_desc:0 "Generositism points out that greed is antithetical to the ideas of harmony, and therefore sharing is expected of all members of society. The means of production are widely distributed, and wealth is partially reorganized. Everyone owns a house and basic luxuries, and cottage industry and small farms are very common. A strong government watches over the people to ensure fairness and peace prevail."

As the ideology was originally formulated by unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies cooperating, it is clear that as more peoples join the allegiance of harmony it will only grow stronger. History is emphasized, even as the nation moves boldly into the future to ensure harmony endures."
